# findcoronacenter.dk
There is a general issue with finding the closest test centers in denmark. You will have to go to various sites. The project simply put makers on a map, that easily let's you find the nearest test center.

## Run locally
Since there is no longer any data of centers (`data.js`) included in this repo you need to run `node update.js` first.
